# Overview 

## Consistency is hard

[Docstring][] is an important part of a codebase. 

Just like all forms of documentation, it goes out of date as code evolves. Even
with the most conscientious team and best of intentions, keeping it 100% fresh
is time-consuming and difficult.

There are many subtle ways a docstring can be "correct":

Picking a style and sticking to it is nice, but spending time in code reviews
to maintain a consistent style is a trade of much efforts with low rewards.

Finally, just like code formats, whitespace errors happens all the time.

For these reason, docstring consistency is essentially impossible.
A linter/formatter like DrString makes life a bit easier for those who cares.

## Anatomy of a docstring in Swift

Pedantry begins with a glossary. So let's look at what elements of a docstring
we can scrutinize about.

(_TODO: this section only talks about docstring for function signatures, there
are other docstring-worthy stuff._)

A docstring is a block of consecutive lines that all starts with `///`. The
first `/` is indented to the same column as its "documentee".

Each parts of a signature corresponds to a section. This includes
- an overall description of the signature
- a description for each parameter
- a description for what it throws if it throws anything
- a description for what it returns, if anything
Sometimes sections are separated with a empty docstring line. Some codebases
don't care about certain sections, such as `throws`.

The keywords "Parameters", "Parameter", "Throws", and "Returns" serve as
prefixes to parts of the docstring. They should be spelled correctly. Their
first letter could be upper- or lowercase by preference, and it's a source of
inconsistency.

Auxillary characters such as `-` and `:`.

Space characters (and lack there of) surrounding various parts. Most of the time
this is pretty strict ("no space before `:`", "1 space after `-`", etc). They
make things visually align vertically.

There are 2 common ways to organize description for multiple parameters (thanks
to Xcode changing its generated docstring over the years).

- The _grouped_ style starts the section with a `- Parameters` header in its own
  line. And each parameter following it is indented, and doesn't need the
  `Parameter` keyword.
- The _separate_ style doesn't have a header for parameters. Each parameter
  begins with ` - Parameter` or ` - parameter`.
