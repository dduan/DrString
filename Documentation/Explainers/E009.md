## E009: Vertical-alignment of descriptions


Each line of description should start at the same column or later. All
descriptions of parameters should start on the same column dictated by the
paramter with the longest name.


### Bad

```swift
/// Description
///
/// - parameter foo: 1 space after `:` is not enough because it's not aligned
/// with `barbaz`. Also, this line started too early
/// - parameter barbaz: but starting in later columns in continued lines is
///                         fine!
func f(foo: Int, barbaz: Int)
```

### Good

```swift
/// Description
///
/// - parameter foo:    Notice how everything is vertically aligned
///                     even for coninuation lines like this one
/// - parameter barbaz: Description
///                         of
///                            barbaz
func f(foo: Int, barbaz: Int)
```
