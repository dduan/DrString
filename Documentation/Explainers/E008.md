## E000: No space before `:`


In documentation for parameters, throws, and returns, the `:` before their
description must have any whitespace characters between it and the word before
it.


### Bad

```swift
/// Description
///
/// - parameter foo : oh no, there's a space before `:`
///
/// - throws : this is no good for throws
///
/// - returns  : more spaces isn't better
func f(foo: Int) throws -> Int
```

### Good

```swift
/// Description
///
/// - parameter foo: 1 space
///
/// - throws: the best
///
/// - returns: yay
func f(foo: Int) throws -> Int
```
